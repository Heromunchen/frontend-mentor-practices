## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

### Center a div using flexbox
Learned how to center main using body as a flexbox and flex: 1 on main to take up all the space available to push attribution to the bottom.
```css
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I am pretty happy with the code in this project. I would improve on code efficiency and using best practices if there's one that i miss.

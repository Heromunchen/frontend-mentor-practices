## Overview

I did this project to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills. It was the first time i built a website without tutorial to follow with. I hoped this project could be a learning experience and review the mistakes i made.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned 2 things from this project.

### Transform and inline-flex
I created a container that adjusts to the HTML content using inline-flex and used transform to center the container on the page.
I learned how to use inline-flex and transform. 

```css
.qrcode-container {
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 30px;
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

    padding-top: 15px;
    padding-left: 15px;
    padding-right: 15px;
    padding-bottom: 25px;
    display: inline-flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Although i used inline-flex on the container to make it adjust to the html content, i am unsure if it is the right situation to use it in. With centering an element or container to the middle of the screen, i am unsure if it is the most efficient way to use it. I want to improve my solutions to these problems in the future.
